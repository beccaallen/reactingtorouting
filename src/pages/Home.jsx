          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Studio Ghibli Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio headquartered in
            Koganei, Tokyo. The studio is best known for its animated feature films,
            and has also produced several short subjects, television commercials,
            and one television film. The studio's mascot and most recognizable
            symbol is a character named Totoro, who is a giant cat-like spirit from
            the 1988 anime film My Neighbor Totoro. Among Studio Ghibli's
            highest-grossing films are Spirited Away (2001), Howl's Moving Castle
            (2004) and Ponyo (2008). The studio was founded on June 15, 1985 by
            directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki,
            after the successful performance of Topcraft's Nausicaä of the Valley of
            the Wind (1984). It has also collaborated with video game studios on the
            visual development of several video games.

          <h3>Name</h3>
          <p>
            The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun ghibli
            (also used in English), based on the Libyan Arabic name for hot desert
            wind (قبلي, 'ghiblī'), the idea being the studio would "blow a new wind
            through the anime industry".[5][6] It also refers to an Italian
            aircraft, the Caproni Ca.309. Although the Italian word would be more
            accurately transliterated as 'Giburi' (ギブリ), with a hard g sound, the
            studio is romanised in Japanese as Jiburi (ジブリ, [dʑiꜜbɯɾi] (About
            this soundlisten)).[5]
